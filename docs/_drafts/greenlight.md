<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>Greenlight is a roleplaying game in which you will direct, produce, write and star in your own television series. Each player will create a character that is the star of their own story-line. Together, you will explore the story of an entire television season in a single session.</p>
<h1 id="rules">Rules</h1>
<h2 id="the-basics">The Basics</h2>
<h3 id="what-youll-need">What you’ll Need</h3>
<ul>
<li>A bunch of note cards. (just bring a whole pack)</li>
<li>Some other human beings. A few or more but, less than lots. (3-5 for people who like numbers)</li>
<li>Writing utensils. Enough to share.</li>
<li>A handful of entropy. (coins or dice work)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-behave">How to Behave</h3>
<p>Be curious and respectful.</p>
<ul>
<li>Think about the fiction earnestly.</li>
<li>Interrogate the fiction by asking questions.</li>
<li>Treat other players as human beings.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="engagement-roll">Engagement Roll</h3>
<p>When asked to make an engagement roll, the player rolls the number of dice indicated and chooses any die as the result. If the result is even, your position is <em>Risky</em>. If the result is odd, your position is <em>Desperate</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No dice? coins work too! Heads, your position is <em>Risky</em>. Tails, your position is <em>Desperate</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Why would you ever choose a <em>Desperate</em> position? See <a href="#the-wrap">The Wrap</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="starting-the-game">Starting the Game</h3>
<p>If this is anyone’s first time playing, read this aloud.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We all know that every story has a beginning and an end. In this game, each character solidifies both these points when they start a season. We play the game to find out what happens in between.</p>
<p>As we craft each scene, it is connected to an ever growing chain of scenes rooted in either the beginning or the end of a character’s story. The stuff in between remains unknown.</p>
<p>We explore the unknown by probing it’s edges. The points closest to what we already know. These points are known as <a href="#when-that-thing-happens-that-changes-everything">The Before</a> and <a href="#when-that-thing-happens-that-changes-everything">The After</a> because they are the points immediately before or after the unknown part of our story.</p>

<p>WIP — skip for now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For each sideways scene a player has, they may do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>add a detail to a location</li>
<li>add a detail to a character</li>
<li>remove an action</li>
<li>change the detail of a plan</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>goals</p>
<ul>
<li>try to figure out what is happening in the gap?</li>
<li>give a player authority based on the current score?</li>
<li>provide some narrative plot twist?</li>
<li>edit the play options?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-wrap">The Wrap</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This is all weird in play so ignore the other rules, just give everyone an opportunity to say something about a scene that happens to their character to tie things together. This could be a flashback before the season, an addition scene in the unknown part or the current season or scene that happens between this season and next.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Count the number of sideways scenes you have, this is your score.</p>
<p>If you have higher score than any other player,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You have lost almost everything and, you are stronger because of it. Everyone despises or pities you but, either way they must respect that you are still here.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have lower score than any other player,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You have had some close calls but, you have come out of the situation with the most important things intact. Everyone adores you… well, almost everyone</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Otherwise,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You fade into the background, you are clearly not as relevant as you thought. Better luck next season if you are still on the show</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Choose either The After or The Before. Taking turns with the other players, move the card on top of this pile to the other one. As you do, narrate a scene from a montage show how your outcome plays out.</p>

<h2 id="guidance">Guidance</h2>
<h3 id="when-you-have-a-plan">When you have a plan</h3>
<p>Be honest about your plans with the other characters. It can be very tempting to try to setup a twist on your own. Resist that urge, let the other players in on your plans enough that they can help you get there.</p>
<h3 id="when-things-go-sideways.">When things go sideways.</h3>
<p>Sometimes you may be required to turn a card sideways. I use landscape as the normal orientation and, portrait as sideways. It doesn’t matter just pick one and be consistent in your group.</p>
<h3 id="when-that-thing-happens-that-changes-everything">When that thing happens that changes everything</h3>
<p>At some point in the story a thing happens, it changes everything! Or maybe it doesn’t… Or maybe its ripples are felt in subtle ways which we are not meant to understand. Sometimes the thing is the same thing for all the characters and sometimes the thing is a different thing.</p>
<p>The point is, there is a thing which we don’t name and we don’t talk about that separates the story into two parts. The parts that happen before it from the parts that happen after it. We call the before part of our story <em>The Before</em> and we represent it with a pile of cards in front of us and to the left. Likewise, We call the after part of our story <em>The After</em> and we represent it with a pile of cards in front of us and to the right.</p>
<h3 id="when-you-take-five">When you take five</h3>
<p>You are going to work on <em>The Pilot</em> and you are going to create an awesome setup for a melodrama about a group of time-traveling android archaeologists in some kind of love dodecahedron. Then, the rules are going to tell you to <em>take 5</em> and you are going to want to ignore it. DON’T! The breaks are there for a reason. They will give your group time to use the bathroom or grab snacks without interrupting the flow of the game later on. They also gives you some time to turn things over in your own brain or lets you talk about things with another player outside the rules of the game.</p>
<h3 id="when-you-cant-agree">When you can’t agree</h3>
<p>Flip a coin, go with it.</p>
<h3 id="when-things-dont-make-any-sense">When things don’t make any sense</h3>
<p>This game takes some liberties with the linearity of time. Finalities such as death can lead to some awkward situations. Here are some ways to avoid the confusion which might be caused by reconciling disparate stories.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let things not make sense. Shows have plot holes all the time. It’s okay!</li>
<li>Literally and figuratively, use a cliffhanger. Don’t chop off someones head when you can kick them over the edge of a cliff and walk away.</li>
<li>Crazy things happen in the real world. Crazier things happen in an imaginary world. Perhaps some fundamental assumption you made about the world is just wrong. Maybe death isn’t so final or maybe you aren’t as good at killing as you thought.</li>
</ul>
