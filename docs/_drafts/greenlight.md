<p>If your group is new to the game or, looking for a set experience, use the actions and plans found <a href="#lists">here</a>. Record on <em>Actions</em> and <em>Plans</em> respectively.</p>
<p>Otherwise, make your group’s own with the following rules</p>
<h4 id="actions">Actions</h4>
<p>These are the verbs of your story. Think about a problem a character might have and ask that character, “What do you do, <em>right now</em>?”</p>
<p>Create three to twelve actions. Record on <em>Actions</em>.</p>

<p>For each plan, leave a blank spot that needs to be filled in later. This is the <em>Detail</em>.</p>
<p>Create two to six plans. Record on <em>Plans</em>.</p>
<p>See <a href="#example-plans">example</a></p>

<p>Things you keep are what you definitely want to be a part of your game. Things you cut from the trailer are things you definitely don’t want in the game.</p>
<p>When it is your turn to write one of these down, you have the final say, Say yes to ideas you are exited to explore. Say no to ideas that are over used or obnoxious.</p>

<h2 id="guidance">Guidance</h2>
<h3 id="when-you-have-a-plan">When you have a plan</h3>
<p>Be honest about your plans with the other characters. It can be very tempting to try to setup a twist on your own. Resist that urge, let the other players in on your plans enough that they can help you get there.</p>
<h3 id="when-things-go-sideways">When things go sideways</h3>
<p>Sometimes you may be required to turn a card sideways. I use landscape as the normal orientation and, portrait as sideways. It doesn’t matter just pick one and be consistent in your group.</p>
<h3 id="when-that-thing-happens-that-changes-everything">When that thing happens that changes everything</h3>
<p>At some point in the story a thing happens, it changes everything! Or maybe it doesn’t… Or maybe its ripples are felt in subtle ways which we are not meant to understand. Sometimes the thing is the same thing for all the characters and sometimes the thing is a different thing.</p>
<p>The point is, there is a thing which we don’t name and we don’t talk about that separates the story into two parts. The parts that happen before it from the parts that happen after it.  We call the before part of our story <em>The Before</em> and we represent it with a pile of cards in front of us and to the left. Likewise, We call the after part of our story <em>The After</em> and we represent it with a pile of cards in front of us and to the right.</p>
<h3 id="when-you-take-five">When you take five</h3>
<p>You are going to work on <em>The Pilot</em> and you are going to create an awesome setup for a melodrama about a group of time-traveling android archaeologists in some kind of love dodecahedron. Then, the rules are going to tell you to <em>take 5</em> and you are going to want to ignore it. DON’T! The breaks are there for a reason. They will give your group time to use the bathroom or grab snacks without interrupting the flow of the game later on. They also gives you some time to turn things over in your own brain or lets you talk about things with another player outside the rules of the game.</p>
<h3 id="when-you-cant-agree">When you can’t agree</h3>
<p>Flip a coin, go with it.</p>
<h3 id="when-things-dont-make-any-sense">When things don’t make any sense</h3>
<p>This game takes some liberties with the linearity of time. Finalities such as death can lead to some awkward situations. Here are some ways to avoid the confusion which might be caused by reconciling disparate stories.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let things not make sense. Shows have plot holes all the time. It’s okay!</li>
<li>Literally and figuratively, use a cliffhanger. Don’t chop off someones head when you can kick them over the edge of a cliff and walk away.</li>
<li>Crazy things happen in the real world. Crazier things happen in an imaginary world. Perhaps some fundamental assumption you made about the world is just wrong. Maybe death isn’t so final or maybe you aren’t as good at killing as you thought.</li>
</ul>
