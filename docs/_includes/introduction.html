<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>This is the home of Yggi Games. Here you will find the results of me playing, poking and hacking games.</p>
<p>My current projects are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Rules Supplements</strong> — Self contained rules which currently build upon 5e by bringing ideas from other sources.</li>
  <li><strong>Project Graph</strong> — A series investigating applications of mathematics in understanding story-telling games.</li>
  <li><strong>Greenlight</strong> — A story-telling game used as a reference implementation of my findings from <strong>Project Graph</strong>.</li>
</ul>
